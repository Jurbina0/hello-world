# hello-world
## Let's try github.

**Hi**, I want to ==seriously== learn about *github*. 
> I've been curious for years but never did the first step.

Now here I am.
1. I want to improve.
2. I want to learn.
3. I want to collaborate.

Also I want to
- Be proud of myself.
- Finish my studies.
- Read more and better.

`import scrapy`
